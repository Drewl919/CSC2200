        I spent most of my life growing up in Downers Grove and attended school <br />
        out there. For high school I went to Downers Grove South and while there <br />
        I was involved in a couple different clubs, but my two favorite were <br />
        research club and radio club. In research club I worked with graduate <br />
        students from Lewis University on a research topic.  The topic was studying <br />
        how to use liquid crystal to prevent lasers from striking pilots' eyes during <br />
        landing and take off.  In radio club, I had my own radio show on my school's <br />
        radio station.  Once I graduated from high school, I moved to North Aurora <br />
        and since this was during COVID, I continued my education at College of DuPage. <br />
        While at CoD, every class that I had was on zoom and that made my time at CoD <br />
        not very enjoyable. However, I was able to finish my associates degree in 3 <br />
        semesters instead of 4. Once done, I left and transferred to Aurora University <br />
        to work towards my bachelors in cybersecurity and computer science. Some of <br />
        the things I enjoy doing include gaming on my computer and listening to music <br />
        any chance I can get. When able, I also really like being out in nature.
